# The Man Breeze – Celebrating AKI Wrestling Games

I’m a ROM hacker and retro game enthusiast dedicated to celebrating and preserving the legacy of AKI wrestling games.  
My work focuses on creative exploration, expanding rosters, experimenting with mechanics, and reimagining classic N64 wrestling experiences.  

I aim for my projects to **feel as if they were created by the original AKI development team**, honoring their style, mechanical depth, and design coherence.  

Development is hobby-first and curiosity-driven: no schedules, no external pressure — just a deliberate practice of play, preservation, and imaginative reconfiguration.
