# Welcome to WrestleHacks

I create custom ROM hacks for classic N64 wrestling games, blending retro nostalgia with fresh ideas. I’m working through several passion projects, focusing on one at a time before moving on to the next.

This space is open for collaboration and idea-sharing with fellow fans and modders who share the same passion for the community.

##  What This GitHub Is For

This profile serves as a development hub for:  
- Dev logs and notes  
- Tools and references  
- Documentation of ROM hacking progress  

I keep things simple and text-based — more of an “engineering notebook” than a social feed.
